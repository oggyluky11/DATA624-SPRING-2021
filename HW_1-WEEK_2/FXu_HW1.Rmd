which.max(gold)
gold[which.max(gold)]
```

# Question - 2.2
Download the file `tute1.csv` from the book website, open it in Excel (or some other spreadsheet application), and review its contents. You should find four columns of information. Columns B through D each contain a quarterly series, labelled Sales, AdBudget and GDP. Sales contains the quarterly sales for a small company over the period 1981-2005. AdBudget is the advertising budget and GDP is the gross domestic product. All series have been adjusted for inflation.

Open it in Excel:
<center>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oggyluky11/DATA624-SPRING-2021/main/HW_1-WEEK_2/Tute1inExcel.PNG)</center>

## a. 
**You can read the data into R with the following script:**
```{r read data}
tute1 <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oggyluky11/DATA624-SPRING-2021/main/HW_1-WEEK_2/tute1.csv', header = TRUE)

#view(tute1)
tute1
```


## b. 
**Convert the data to time series**
```{r convert to ts}
mytimeseries <- ts(tute1[,-1], start=1981, frequency=4)

head(mytimeseries)
```

## c. 
**Construct time series plots of each of the three series**
```{r autoplot with facets}
autoplot(mytimeseries, facets=TRUE)
```

**Check what happens when you don't include `facets=TRUE`**
```{r autoplot without facets}
autoplot(mytimeseries)
```

# Question - 2.3
Download some monthly Australian retail data from the book website. These represent retail sales in various categories for di􀁼erent Australian states, and are stored in a MS-Excel file.

## a.
**You can read the data into R with the following script:**
```{r read data 2}
#retaildata <- read_excel('retail.xlsx', skip=1)
retaildata <- import('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oggyluky11/DATA624-SPRING-2021/main/HW_1-WEEK_2/retail.xlsx', skip=1)

retaildata
```

## b.
**Select one of the time series as follows (but replace the column name with your own chosen column):**
```{r convert to ts 2}
myts<- ts(retaildata[,"A3349398A"], frequency=12, start=c(1982,4))
```

## c.
**Explore your chosen retail time series using the following functions:**
`autoplot()`, `ggseasonplot()`, `ggsubseriesplot()`, `gglagplot()`, `ggAcf()`

1) `autoplot()`
```{r autoplot 2.3}
autoplot(myts) +
  ggtitle('Monthly Food Retailing in Australia')
```

2) `ggseasonplot()`
```{r ggseasonplot 2.3}
ggseasonplot(myts)
ggseasonplot(myts, polar = TRUE) + ggtitle('Seaonal Plot: myts - Polar Coordinate')
```


3) `ggsubseriesplot()`
```{r ggsubseriesplot 2.3}
ggsubseriesplot(myts) + ggtitle('Subseries Plot: myts')

```

4) `gglagplot()`
```{r gglagplot 2.3}
gglagplot(myts) + ggtitle('Lag Plot: myts')

```


5) `ggAcf()`
```{r ggAcf 2.3}
ggAcf(myts) + ggtitle('ACF Plot: myts')
```


**Can you spot any seasonality, cyclicity and trend? What do you learn about the series?**

**Answer:**

1. Seasonality can be spotted as shown in the lag plot that there is a strongly positive relationship between sales values and lag values through out lag 1 to lag 16, tipically in lag 12, reflecting very strong seasonality in the data.

2. Trend can be spotted as shown in the ACF plot that trended time series tend to have positive values that slowly decrease as the lags increase. The correlations are significantly different from zero confirming that the fluctuation is not white noise.

3. Cyclicity is not spotted in the autoplot as there is no obvious business cycle with duration of at least 2 years.

4. From the plots above, we learn that this time series has an inscreasing trend and strong monthly seasonality (frequency=12) and with time range from year 1982 to 2013.
